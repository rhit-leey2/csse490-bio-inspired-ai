# HW2

For a given assignment please be sure to:

1.  Include your source code inside of the "source_code" folder
2.  Include any "awesomesauce" deliverables files in the "awesomesauce" and complete the "awesomesauce" submission form (linked on Moodle)
3.  Include a PDF version of your summary report in the "report" folder

Note: The example folder contains helpful resources, but is not required to be used

Each assignment will be awarded a pass or fail based on whether it demonstrates completion of the primary goal. However, you are encouraged to identify AT least one interesting use or extension of your solution.

Exceptional submissions may be eligible for "awesomesauce" if they meet one of the following:
1. Creative - novel, unique, or even "weird" exploration (its OK to take risks and make mistakes!)
2. Surprising - for example an experiment that had very counter-intuitive results
3. Significant - demonstrates an insightful connection to a natural phenomenon
4. Artistic - includes a visualization that provides a new perspective or insight

If you feel want to propose a separate assignment for yourself, potentially based on the materials present here:
