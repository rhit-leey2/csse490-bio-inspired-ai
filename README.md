# CSSE490 Bio-inspired Artificial Intelligence

CSSE 490-03: Bio-Inspired Artificial Intelligence (Fall 2022)
 
### Course Description: <br>
Artificial Intelligence strives to create machines that exhibit intelligence, but there are a wide variety of approaches towards pursuing this goal. In this course, students will learn about theories and methods of creating AI systems as inspired by biological phenomena. To deepen understanding of topics, students will create or modify bio-inspired AI systems during weekly programming assignments. Throughout the course, students will become acquainted with selected topics in the closely related and overlapping fields of artificial life and cognitive science. Throughout the course, students will be encouraged to consider more deeply the nature of intelligence, learning, and even life itself. As a final assessment, students will produce a high quality project proposal based on a topic from or related to the course.

### Textbook and Resources: <br>
The course will make use of the required textbook: 
Bio-Inspired Artificial Intelligence (Free RHIT Access), resources from itâ€™s companion website, as well as additional selected supplemental readings/videos

### Course Objectives: <br>
There are several major objectives for the course:
  - Gain familiarity with biologically-inspired artificial intelligence theories and methods
  - Gain experience creating and modifying bio-inspired AI systems, reproducing published results
  - Gain experience conducting experiments, analyzing results, and presenting findings
  - Create a high quality project proposal based upon techniques and topics from this course
